# Whisperer - AI Text Workflow Agent

## Overview

Whisperer is an AI-powered agent designed for text classification, entity extraction, and summarization using **LangGraph**, **Streamlit**, and **Llama LLM** (via **Groq**). This application provides an interactive interface to process user input, classify text, extract relevant entities, and summarize it in a single workflow. The project demonstrates a seamless integration of multiple AI tasks within a simple, scalable architecture.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Classifies the input text into one of the categories: News, Blog, Research, or Other.
  
- **Entity Extraction**: Extracts entities such as Person, Organization, and Location from the input text.

- **Summarization**: Summarizes the given text into a concise single-sentence output.

- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input text and receive results through a chat-like UI.

## Tech Stack

- **LangGraph**: To create and manage complex language model workflows in a state-driven graph structure.
- **Llama LLM (via Groq)**: Llama 3.1, a versatile 70-billion parameter model used for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.
- **Python**: The main programming language for this project.
- **Dotenv**: For environment variable management, such as handling API keys.
